A 3D tile map JavaScript engine created with Three.js. 

Keep an eye on it's progress and updates by checking the [sandbox](https://christophgomez.github.io/tiles.js/
) every now and then.

## Why
This project is a personal hobby project of mine that developed out of the interest to develop a Steam game with the tools and languages I know and love (modern web technologies).

The engine uses Three.js for WebGL rendering, Webpack and Babel in order to utilize modern ES6/7 and TypeScript language features, and runs on React in the browser (or plain old HTML) or natively on the desktop thanks to Electron. 

The goal is a a highly performant engine that can be used to render 3D polygonal hex scenes with easy to follow documentation so anyone with some programming experience can use.
