# threejs-tilemap
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christophgomez/threejs-tilemap/master/map.png)

A small tile-map JavaScript engine created with Three.js. 

Work In Progress. Currently working towards release as an NPM package.

Keep an eye on it's progress and updates by checking the [sandbox](https://christophgomez.github.io/threejs-tilemap/
) every now and then.

(Maybe I should make the sandbox an editor)
